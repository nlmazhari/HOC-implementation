#h1 React Front-End Dev Task

The goal is to build a modular, reusable form system using React components and ES6+ JavaScript. Be prepared to show off 
1) a generic `Form` system which can handle any type of form we want (Reusable Component) and 
2) a single implementation of that system with specific requirements (Single Implementation)

The form system has the following requirements:
Positioning of elements using `Styled Components` 
Two validators are set for this project: 
* a ‘required’ validator which asserts that a form field is not empty, 
* and a ‘number’ validator which assets that only numeric characters are inputted
Return values are printed to the console
